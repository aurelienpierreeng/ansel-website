[11842]: "For the website and documentation, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) handles the translations of any given page `new_page.md` using the naming convention `new_page.LANG.md`, where `LANG` is the language code. Hugo natively supports manually writing these translated files in the same folder as their original, however, here we generate them using the `.po` translation file and the program `po4a`. The `build-modules.sh` and `tools/auto-translate.sh` scripts handle this internally, but you may want to generate those file manually :\n"
