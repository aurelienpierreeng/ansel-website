<div class="lead my-5 ps-3">This page will show you how and where you can learn and get help, in particular on Ansel, but also in general on photography.</div>

## General info

Ansel is mostly a one-person operation. This is good news when it comes to keeping developement in sync with users needs and expectations, not so much when it comes to balancing the workload. So everything that could be automated was automated for the developer's sanity, and you are asked to use the online resources first everytime it is possible.

{{< warning >}}
When you submit a bug report or book a training session, please upload your attachment files on my [private cloud](https://cloud.apmlt.net/s/YAdfYajPkE5nLyW) instead of using third-party hosting services with an expiration date : there is no guaranty IÂ will download the files in time and it keeps things tidy for me.
{{< /warning >}}


## Online learning resources

There already is a fair deal of information around on Ansel's usage. As Ansel is based on darktable 4.0, most tutorials on darktable 4.x (and 3.x, to a lesser extent) are still relevant, even though the GUIÂ may be slightly different.

Chantal is a __bilingual AIÂ language model__ trained specifically for open-source __image processing and photography__, coupled with a search engine that indexes more than __47.000 pages__, including Ansel docs, bug reports and forum threads.

It acts as your virtual librarian and can greatly improve access to information when you are __not sure of the exact terms__ to look for because __it understands synonyms__ and context.

## Support and training with the developer

Getting a chance to learn how to use the tools directly with their developer is a pretty rare opportunity as far as software goes. Ansel gives it to you, with 1-on-1 personalized assistance through video-conferencing.

Everything that leads to the software crashing, producing invalid output or unusable core features is a bug.

If a feature seems to have been removed or to work differently, that might be a redesign, and there is always a reason behind.
